# intl-polyfill
Shallow Intl Polyfill for react-intl

# Description
Short version: don't use it.

Longer version: it is extremely shallow version of [Intl.js](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js). It was developed for my side-project needs with intention to keep overall bundle size as little as possible, which means that *probably* it is not going to meet your needs.

No support, documentation or whatever is planned.
